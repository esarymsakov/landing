                    <p>Hello. My name is Emil Sarymsakov. <br>
                        I learned HTML and CSS last one week. Today I was made my first Landing Page with using HTML language and CSS syntax. But I had expirience with WordPress CMS and I think it was helped to me with my new learning. Also I want to say, that I started to learning English language.</p>

                    <h2>How Am I Different?</h2>
                    <p>After a long search, I realized that the only thing you need to constantly do is to act. And now Just Do It sounds completely different. This phrase has real meaning and depth.</p>
                    <p>What is the difference between you and the most successful people in the world? It immediately comes to your mind that the difference is in your financial condition, but this is a big delusion. Money is just a reflection of how these people interact with life. You are distinguished by the nature of interaction with life.</p>
                    <p>Elon Musk, like any other successful person from Forbes, interacts with his life to the maximum. These people never considered themselves victims of circumstances. These people are the creators of their circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Being a creator is a concept of life that includes many aspects. For example, people in that 1% are never afraid of change. And it is this aspect that radically distinguishes this group of people from the rest of the 99%. It is the fact that they are not afraid of change and that they juggle change masterfully that makes them who they are. And money only reflects their confident interaction with their own lives.</p>
